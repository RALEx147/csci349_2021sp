# CSCI349 Data Mining Final project

## Motive
To analyze English speech online to classify hatespeech and vulgar language. This will go through models that can interact with language that has not been seen during classes or labs.

## Data

[Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/master/data/labeled_data.csv
