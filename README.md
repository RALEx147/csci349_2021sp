# CSCI349 Spring 2021 - Data Mining

## This Course    
#### This is a 300 level elective on data mining with Professor King.

## About me    
#### I am Robb Alexander and I am a senior at Bucknell University graduating with a bachelor of science in Computer Science and a double major in philosophy.    

## Skills 
#### I am interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency, specifically smart contract technology (i.e. ethereum, eos, neo).    
#### I also enjoy working in the apple ecosystem, wether it be iOS app architecture or iOS security exploits (i.e jailbreak tweaks)
#### I use python primarily for day to day programming, for fun or for practical scrapping/regex filtering. This is the language Ive most experience with due to the amount of time used for algorithm technical interview questions.

## Plans for graduation
#### I am currently practicing algorithm questions in hopes of finding a job, if I don't get an offer before the end of February I will be relaxing until the next hiring cycle for software engineering roles in August/September.
